    """Extract a summary from html text.

    This function first looks for an HTML comment whose text matches the
    regular expression **cut_mark**.  If such a comment is found, all text
    after that comment is deleted, and the result is returned.
    The truncation is done in an HTML-aware manner.  The result should be
    a valid HTML fragment: it will not contain dangling tags, etc.

    If no cut mark is found, then the text is truncated at the first
    block element such that there are at least ``min_words`` words in
    the preserved (preceding) text.

    If no suitable truncation point can be found, ``None`` is
    returned.

    Args:
        html_text: The input text, a string.
        min_words: When finding a block-level truncation point, retain
            at least this many words of the original text.  Set to
            ``None`` to disable block-level truncation.
        cut_mark: A regular expression which is to be matched against
            the text of HTML comments in ``html_text`` to find a
            truncation point.  Pass ``None`` to disable.

    Returns:
        If an acceptable truncation point is found, returns the
        truncated HTML text, as a string.  If there is no acceptable
        truncation point, returns ``None``.
